### 1. Executive Summary ###
   Elist recorded $28.12M in total sales revenue from 2019 to 2022, with approximately 108K orders placed across product categories including laptops, audio devices, phones, and accessories. 
   Sales peaked at $1.25M in December 2020, likely driven by holiday demand, before gradually declining to a low of $0.18M in October 2022.

   Sales performance showed a clear concentration in high-value products. MacBook Air and ThinkPad laptops consistently contributed the majority of total revenue despite lower order volumes with only 6,880 combined orders, 
   their $1,381.05 average order value (AOV) far exceeded other categories, underscoring the outsized role premium products play in overall business performance.

   From a regional perspective, North America emerged as the dominant market, accounting for 51.78% of total revenue. In contrast, APAC and LATAM demonstrated comparatively lower demand and 
   higher variability in product performance, signaling opportunities for targeted regional strategies and deeper market penetration.

   Membership Growth (top bars):
   Loyalty member growth started very low at 1.83% in 2019, surged to a peak of 19.14% in 2021, then eased back to 11.31% in 2022. Non-loyalty growth followed a similar arc but peaked earlier in 2020 at 19.28%, then steadily declined    to 9.97% by 2022. This suggests the loyalty program gained strong momentum through 2021 but may be maturing or slowing in its ability to attract new members.
   
   AOV % (bottom lines):
   Loyalty members showed steady AOV growth from $207 in 2019 to $245 in 2022, while non-loyalty customers were more volatile, peaking at $345 in 2020 before declining to $214 in 2022. 
   Notably, 2022 marks the first year loyalty members outspent non-loyalty customers, suggesting the program is beginning to drive stronger purchasing behavior, though there remains room to further incentivize 
   higher spend among members.

   Overall, the analysis highlights Elist’s reliance on premium products for revenue growth, the strong performance of the North American market, and clear opportunities to enhance loyalty program effectiveness and 
   regional sales strategies.

#### Key Insights ####

2020 represents the strongest revenue year, driven by sustained YoY growth across most months.

2022 shows significant YoY contraction, especially in the second half of the year, signaling demand slowdown.

Sales exhibit clear seasonality, with consistent uplift during Q3–Q4, making these months critical for planning. 

#### 2. Orders Analysis ####

| Insight Area | Key Observation | Business Interpretation |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| YoY Growth Pattern | Strong YoY growth in 2020 and 2021 across most months, followed by sharp declines in 2022 | Demand surged during recovery years and weakened significantly in 2022 |
| Seasonality | Orders consistently peak during Q3–Q4 | Seasonal demand and campaigns strongly influence order volume |
| Volatility | 2022 shows steep negative YoY values (especially Sep–Dec) | Indicates customer demand contraction rather than short-term fluctuation |

| | 🟦 Positive Growth · 🟧 Negative Growth |


#### Key Insights ####

Order volumes experienced strong YoY expansion in 2020–2021, reflecting increased customer acquisition and demand.

A sharp YoY decline in 2022 suggests a slowdown in customer purchasing behavior rather than operational issues.

Seasonal spikes in Q3–Q4 remain consistent, highlighting the importance of demand planning during peak months.

#### 3. Average Order Value (AOV) ####

  
| Insight Area | Key Observation | Business Interpretation |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| YoY Stability | AOV remains relatively stable compared to orders and sales | Revenue volatility is driven more by volume than basket size |
| 2021 Decline | Majority of 2021 months show negative YoY AOV | Increased discounting or shift toward lower-priced products |
| 2022 Recovery | AOV decline moderates in 2022 with some positive YoY months | Pricing strategy or product mix improvement |

| | 🟦 Positive Growth · 🟧 Negative Growth |



#### Key Insights ####

AOV in 2020 surged across all months (peak: +43.65% YoY in 
August), suggesting pandemic demand drove both volume and 
higher-value purchases simultaneously confirming 2020 
growth was broad-based rather than volume-driven alone.

AOV declined sharply through 2021, with every month recording 
negative YoY figures, bottoming at -22.36% in December
indicating customers shifted toward lower-value purchases as 
pandemic demand normalized.

2022 showed partial stabilization, with September returning 
to modest positive YoY growth (+3.55%), though overall AOV 
remained under pressure suggesting pricing strategy or 
product mix adjustments may be needed to restore pre-pandemic 
spending levels.

#### Key Insights

The 27in 4K Gaming Monitor is the standout revenue driver, 
peaking at $3.35M in 2021 — notably a year later than most 
products, suggesting sustained demand beyond the initial 
pandemic surge and making it the most resilient high-value 
product in the portfolio.

MacBook Air and Apple AirPods together dominated the 2020 
peak, contributing over $5.5M combined — confirming that 
premium laptops and audio products were the primary 
beneficiaries of pandemic-driven electronics demand.

All products experienced revenue contraction in 2022, 
indicating the decline is market-wide rather than 
product-specific — pointing to an external demand issue 
rather than individual product failure.

Bose SoundSport Headphones recorded negligible revenue 
across all four years, with a peak of just $2,118 in 2020 
— making it a strong candidate for discontinuation to 
free up inventory and marketing resources.
















| Orders Quantity | Strong and consistent Q3 and Q4 sales spikes are observed across products, driven by Holiday shopping. The 2.7in 4k Gaming monitor, Samsung Charging cable pack and apple airpods shows the largest Q4 order surge, reinforcing the their role as seasonal bestsellers. Sales typically dip in Jan and Feb, reflecting post holiday demand slowdown. Macbook Air, Thinkpad laptops demonstrate consistent baseline demand, with stable order volume throughout Q2 and Q3, though lower than Q4 peaks. Order volume is highly seasonal, with Q4 driving a disproportionate share of annual orders. Core products maintaine steady demand year over year making them reliable revenue anchors. Non-core products shows negligible order activity.| Alignn inventory and marketing strategies to captialize on Q4 demand spikes. Use Q1 promotions to smooth post holiday sales declines. Focus on product expansion and cross selling around consistently demanded products.|
| AOV | AOV peaked in 2020 at $300.16, driven by increased demand for high ticket items during the pandamic. AOV declined in 2021($254.71) and 2022 ($229.91), reflecting post pandamic normalisation. The Macbook Air ($1588.12), Thinkpad Laptop ($1099.56) and apple iphone ($740.72) are the largest contributors to AOV, due to high price point. Low cost products such as the Samsung Charging Cable pack ($20.20) and Samsung Webcam ($50.43) maintain stable sales but have minimal impact on AOV.| AOV is heavily influenced by premium products mix, not pricing chnages. Reduced demand for high ticket items directly lower AOV Lower priced accessories provide volume stabilty but not materially improve revenue per order.| Provide incentives on high AOV products through finiancing options, limited time offers, or loyalty program rewards. Use accessories as add on rather than standalone sales to lift AOV Promote laptop and monitor bundles during peak season to stabalize AOV.|
| Refund Rate |Most Refunded Products: Bose Soundsport Headphones, Samsung Charging Cable Pack, and Samsung Webcam show the highest refund rates. Least Refunded Products: MacBook Air Laptop and ThinkPad Laptop consistently rank among the lowest in refund rates. Apple AirPods Headphones maintain a relatively consistent refund rate year over year. Accessories tend to have higher historical refund rates than laptops. Refund rates steadily decline from 2019 to 2022.  | Accessory and electronics add-ons may face higher compatibility or quality issues, requiring better product descriptions and QA checks. High-value products show stronger customer satisfaction and confidence, supporting continued focus on premium product offerings.|
