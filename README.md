### 1. Executive Summary ###
   Elist recorded a **total sales revenue of $28.12M** over a **2019 - 2022 year period**, with approximately **108k orders** placed across all the product categories, including laptops, audio devices, phones and accessories.

   Sales performance showed a clear concentration in high-value products, with **MacBooks Air Laptops and ThinkPads Laptops** consistently contributing the majority of total revenue despite lower order volumes. With overall **6880 order counts** and **$ 1381.05 average order value (AOV)** was largely driven by laptop sales, highlighting the importance of premium products to overall business performance.

From a regional perspective, **North America** emerged as the strongest market, accounting for the largest share of **51.75%** revenue across all years. In contrast, other regions like **APAC and LATAM** showed comparatively lower demand and higher variability in product performance, indicating opportunities for targeted regional strategies and improved market penetration.

Analysis of customer behavior revealed that **12% in 2019 to over 50% by 2021** grew by **loyalty program members**, with higher repeat purchase rates compared to non-members. However, with **$30** difference in **AOV between loyalty and non-loyalty customers** suggests that the program may benefit from stronger incentives and personalization to further drive engagement and long-term retention.

Overall, the analysis highlights Elist’s reliance on premium products for revenue growth, the strong performance of the North American market, and clear opportunities to enhance loyalty program effectiveness and regional sales strategies.
